# Lock Screen Picture Grabber

This is a utility to retrieve Windows 10 Spotlight images from the lock screen and save
them in your Pictures folder. It opens the images in the hidden data folder and lets you
pick which ones to save (you'll need to set the filename before clicking save for a
selected image, and it's too dumb to ask you whether you want to overwrite an exsiting image).

It has not been tested on computers other than my own. The code project is a Visual Studio 2010
WPF project, but should work fine on newer versions.

A prebuilt executable is in the Release folder:

If you just want to try the app, get and run that file.

## Development Status

This was a one-off app that I wrote in about an hour because I wanted to save 
a Windows 10 login screen that I liked. It has not been thoroughly tested and I
am willing to accept pull requests if you have improvements to contribute.
